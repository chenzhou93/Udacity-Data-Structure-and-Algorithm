Task 0
It asked the first record for each csv file so the retreieve takes O(1) to process regarding time complexity.

Task 1
I use the Set collection in Python to track unique values for numbers.
I need to loop through all records read from csv for both files, the time complexity is O(n).

Task 2
The solution idea is to find the maximum value of a record in terms of time spending in a particular month: September 2016, which is stored at last column in the csv file.
To find the max value, instead of sorting all of them, I stored all calls in September 2016 in a dictionaly, then ran a loop for key and value pair, compared and replaced the maximum value as the final result.
Looping through all records takes O(n).

Task 3
Part A requires some case processes based on the type of call number, so I used conditional checking/process in a loop with some helper functions.
As the output needs to be sorted, the sorting method in Python takes O(nlogn). The for loop that process the data takes O(n).

Part B only needs to screen all phone numbers again so it also takes O(n).

Task 4
I intended to use Set operation to find those unique phone numbers that meet the task requirement,
but building those sets takes O(n) as it looped through all records.

For set operation time complexity I am not sure, as Google said it may take O(1).

As the task requires, the output has to be sorted so the sorting process takes O(nlogn).
